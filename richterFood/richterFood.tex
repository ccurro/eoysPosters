	This showcase is a collaboration between the students from the applied
	food science an engineering course and the Culinary Club here at Cooper.
	The recipes here are all adapted from the winning recipes in the ``kitchen
	arena'' final project of the food science class.  From left to right, we
	have a deconstructed pop tart with chocolate and clementine and an earl
	grey cookie base, the winning fudge recipe (named ``uptown fudge''), and a
	reconstruction of grilled cheese and tomato soup with a cheese soup at the
	base of the glass topped with a tomato espuma.
