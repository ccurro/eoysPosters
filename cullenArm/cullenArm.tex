    Arm is a life-sized endoskeletal structure that mimics the movement of a
	human arm. Computer-controlled linear and rotary actuators are used to operate
	Arm, and the automaton is programmed to perform and communicate its human-like
	features. Freud’s theory of the Uncanny was employed in order to contextualize
	aspects of a biomimetic robot based on the response evoked from a human
	audience. Arm’s main endoskeletal structure is made entirely of brass, and is
	manufactured in a manner that seeks to manipulate simple motor functions to
	subsequently produce a more nuanced and believable representation of human
	motion. All moving parts are exposed in order to provide an easily
	understandable, and ultimately more inviting, mechanically performative
	experience.
